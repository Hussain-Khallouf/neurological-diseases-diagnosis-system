# Neurological diseases diagnosis System
### A website used to be An expert system for Neurological diseases diagnosing
## This project consists of these parts:
1. ### Knowledge Base System: by collecting data from an Expert, I build an expert system (that is figured in the .drawio file) using the expert pip package.
2. ### Web Server: for handling endpoints using FastAPI framework.
3. ### Template to render: user interfaces that are rendered from the server.


##This project is implemented based on the *Clear Architecture of Uncle Bop*.
